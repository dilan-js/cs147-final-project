# CS147 Final Project

In this class, our primary goal is to by a need relating to Arts & Culture, and then based off of a robust set of tests, interviews, prototypes, we configure a final, high-fidelity prototype. This prototype's primary purpose is to demonstrate what need we found and how we decided to tackle said need. 

For this class, my teammates Josh, Ben, and myself interviewed several people and concluded that people have a difficulty finding good, new music. 
We then formulated and test our assumption that people who listen to popular music can figure out whether they like or dislike a song in 15 seconds.
